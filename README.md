# Javascript Movie Fight App

This is a Javascript project I had made that searches the OMDB API database, returns two movies, compares their statistics, and whoever has the highest score wins! The best part about building this app, is that I built the autocomplete widget within the app to be reusable code for other apps. 

## Getting Started

You can view the app here: https://kmulligan01.github.io/Movie-Fight/ <br >
Start typing in a movie on either side, select movie from the autocomplete dropdown, and you will see your movie and stats displayed. The stats in green are the winners, and the stats in yellow are the losers.

## Built With

* Javascript ES6
* Bulma.io CSS
* HTML5
* http://www.omdbapi.com/ - API where questions and answers are fetched from
